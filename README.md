## Introduction
For this project, we were required to use the Java RMI framework to develop a remote, asynchronous string
comparison service. This project compares two strings against each other and returns the distance between the 
strings depending on the algorithm that was chosen. The way the application works is there are two boxes shown 
to the user where a string can be input to compare them. It also offers the user a list of algorithms from a drop down menu.
When the user has input their message string, they must then click compare. This redirects the user to another page where 
the request is processed. This refreshes every 10 seconds to check if the proccess is complete. Once completed, the distance 
between string one and string two is output.
